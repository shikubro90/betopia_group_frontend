        description: `By, Muhammad Monir Hossain, Founder & CEO of Betopia Group\n\nWhen I think about what defines a strong, forward-thinking company, the answer is simple: people. The right people, with the right mindset and skills, are the engine behind everything we do at Betopia Group.\nBut here’s the truth—not all great people get a fair shot. And that’s exactly why the EDGE Project matters.\n\nA Solution That Met Us Where We Were\nAt Bdcalling IT Ltd., one of our tech companies under the Betopia umbrella, we often face a familiar problem: talented graduates who are full of potential but not quite ready for the demands of the job.\nWhen we heard about the EDGE initiative—particularly the Hire and Train Program—we saw something different. This wasn’t just another skills training scheme. It was a bridge. A bridge between academic theory and real-world application. Between potential and performance.\n\nOne of our most inspiring hires, Sumiya Afrin, came to us through this program. She had the right degree, a great attitude—but like many young graduates, she hadn’t had the opportunity to apply her knowledge in a meaningful way.\nThanks to EDGE, that changed.\n\nShe joined Bdcalling as a web developer, equipped with more than just technical skills. She had confidence. She understood workflows, collaboration, and how to add value from day one. Today, she’s not just part of the team—she’s helping lead projects that matter.\n\nWhy This Program Works\nWhat sets EDGE apart is its holistic approach. It doesn’t just train people; it nurtures them. It works with employers. It responds to real industry needs. And most importantly, it gives people a chance—often when they need it most.\nAs a business leader, I’ve always believed that our responsibility extends beyond our office walls. If we want a better industry, we must help build it—one person, one opportunity at a time.\nEDGE is making that possible.\n\nThe Bigger Picture\nBeyond talent development, what excites me most about EDGE is its investment in innovation. From AI-powered road safety apps to life-changing medical devices like the Pedograph Machine, this initiative is laying the groundwork for a smarter, more inclusive digital economy.\nThe Research and Innovation Centers (RICs) popping up at universities are doing more than funding ideas—they’re helping turn those ideas into real solutions for real people.\nAt Betopia Group, we see alignment here—not just with our business goals, but with our values.\n\nLooking Ahead\nWe’re proud to be part of this ecosystem. As the CEO of Betopia Group, I’ve seen firsthand what’s possible when you give bright minds the tools and trust to thrive.\nMy hope is that more companies—big or small—step up and collaborate with programs like EDGE. Because when you invest in people, you don’t just build better businesses. You build a better future.\nAnd that’s something worth showing up for every day.`,
